```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
require(ISLR)
require(tidyverse)

```

## R Markdown
Let's look at the summary of Auto database:

```{r cars}
summary(Auto)
```

## Including Plots

Next, let's create a plot with mpg as the response and horsepower as the predictor.  

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(Auto, aes(x = mpg, y = horsepower)) +
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = lm)

```

Quuestion 2
```{r}
cor(Auto$mpg, Auto$horsepower)
```
First,
the $RSE$ estimates the standard deviation of the response from the
population regression line. For this model, the RSE is 5.554
units while the mean value for the response is ...., indicating a
percentage error of roughly 21%, which is a pretty big error and the end users would have to decide if that's okay.... . (See ISLR Section 3.1.3)
